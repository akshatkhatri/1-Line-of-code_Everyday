/*Introduction:
The provided C++ code defines a class Solution with a member function maxWidthOfVerticalArea, which calculates the maximum width of a vertical area formed by a set of points on a two-dimensional plane. The input to the function is a vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents a point with its x and y coordinates. The code aims to determine the maximum difference between consecutive x-axis values among the given points.

Explanation:

    Data Structure:
        The code initializes a vector x_axis to store the x-axis values of each point and an integer variable max_diff to track the maximum difference between consecutive x-axis values.

    Extracting X-axis Values:
        A nested loop iterates through each point in the input vector.
        The inner loop extracts the x-axis value (the first element of each inner vector) and adds it to the x_axis vector.

    Sorting X-axis Values:
        The x_axis vector is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the calculation of differences between consecutive values.

    Calculating Maximum Width:
        Another loop iterates through the sorted x_axis vector in reverse order.
        For each pair of consecutive x-axis values, the code calculates the difference and updates the max_diff variable if the current difference is greater than the existing maximum difference.

    Result:
        The final result is the maximum difference (max_diff) calculated from the sorted x-axis values, representing the maximum width of a vertical area formed by the given points.

Conclusion:
In summary, the provided C++ code efficiently calculates the maximum width of a vertical area formed by a set of points. It utilizes a vector to store and manipulate the x-axis values, sorting them to facilitate the calculation of the maximum width. The approach demonstrates an understanding of basic sorting algorithms and is designed to optimize the process of finding the maximum difference between consecutive x-axis values.
